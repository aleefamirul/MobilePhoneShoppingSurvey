UDEMY - Data Analysis &amp; Statisstic: Practical Course for Beginners

## Overview 
This course is designed to introduce beginners to the fundamental concepts of data analysis and statistics. It provides a practical, hands-on approach, making it accessible even to those without prior experience. The course emphasizes understanding core statistical concepts and applying them to real-world problems using practical tools.
originally, the analysis were made in google sheets due to accessibility, but I took an approach to do it in EXCEL instead. 

## key features 
1. **Introduction to Data Analysis:** Covers the essentials of handling and analyzing data, including basic data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
2. **Core Statistical Concepts:** Explains fundamental statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.
3. **Data Visualization:** Teaches how to create clear and effective visualizations using tools like charts, graphs, and plots.
4. **Practical Applications:** Includes exercises and projects to help learners apply concepts to real-life datasets.
5. **Software Integration:** Guides learners on how to use popular data analysis tools, potentially including Excel, Python, or other platforms.
6. **User-Friendly Format:** Tailored for those new to statistics or looking to enhance their analytical skills with practical knowledge.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation 

1. Understanding Raw Data
- Overview of raw datasets and common issues encountered, such as:
    - Missing values.
    - Duplicates.
    - Inconsistent formats.
- Exploring the importance of clean data for accurate analysis.
2. Identifying and Handling Missing Data
- Recognizing missing data patterns in datasets.
- Strategies for handling missing values, including:
    - Removing rows or columns with excessive missing data.
    - Imputation techniques (e.g., replacing with mean, median, or mode).
3. Detecting and Removing Duplicates
- Learning to identify duplicate rows or entries in a dataset.
Methods to clean duplicates effectively while preserving unique records.
4. Standardizing Data Formats
- Ensuring consistency in:
Date and time formats.
Text and categorical variables (e.g., case sensitivity, trimming extra spaces).
Numerical precision and units of measurement.
5. Dealing with Outliers
- Understanding the impact of outliers on statistical analysis.
Techniques to identify outliers using statistical methods or visualizations.
Approaches to manage outliers (e.g., capping, transformation, or exclusion).
6. Data Type Conversion
- Converting data into appropriate formats, such as:
Strings to dates.
Categorical variables to numerical codes.
Resolving errors caused by improper data types.
